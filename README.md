# Movie Hub

## Project Description
Movie Hub is a web application designed to provide users with easy access to the latest movies, allowing them to watch any film of their choice. The platform offers a user-friendly and personalized experience by saving user preferences and filtering movies based on genre and type. Our goal is to give people a chance to watch movies for free, without interruptions from ads, so they can enjoy a seamless viewing experience.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Users can log in and log out securely. 
  - Session data (username) is stored in local storage, allowing the session to persist across page reloads.
  
- **User Preferences (Light/Dark Mode)**:
  - Users can toggle between light and dark mode for a customized viewing experience.
  - The selected mode is saved in local storage, ensuring it remains even when the user revisits or refreshes the page.

- **Movie Filtering**:
  - Users can filter movies by genre, such as Action, Sci-Fi, and Drama, to quickly find content that matches their interests.
  - The selected filter setting is saved in local storage, so the application remembers the userâ€™s choice even after the page reloads.

- **Personalized Experience with Local Storage**:
  - Movie Hub uses local storage to remember user settings (authentication, theme mode, and filters), allowing users to enjoy a consistent experience across sessions.

- **Responsive and Polished Design**:
  - The interface is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  - Consistent typography, cohesive color schemes, and a clean design ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

## How User Preferences are Managed
Movie Hub utilizes the browser's local storage to manage user preferences, ensuring a seamless and personalized experience. Each preference, such as login status, theme mode, and selected movie filter, is saved locally. This allows the application to load user-specific settings automatically whenever they return, without requiring re-login or preference re-selection.

## How to Use
1. **Login**: Start by logging in or registering to personalize your experience.
2. **Switch Mode**: Use the toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
3. **Filter Movies**: Choose a genre from the filter dropdown to display movies of a specific type.
4. **Browse Movies**: Explore the catalog and click on a movie to learn more or begin watching.
5. **Logout**: Click the logout button to end the session.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structuring content.
- **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and local storage management.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more categories and genres for a wider selection of movies.
- Implementing a movie recommendation system based on user preferences.
- Adding a "favorites" feature to save movies users wish to watch later.
